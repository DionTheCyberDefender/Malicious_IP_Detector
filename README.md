# Malicious_IP_Detector

Purpose: 
For my first Cybersecurity related Python Script, I wanted to create a toolkit utilizing one of my favorite IP detection tools AbuseIP Database. The purpose of this script is to receive the user's input of a valid IP address and search the outcome via AbuseIPDB. This script will search an IP's repitation/malicious score and provide it's attributes.
