# Malicious_IP_Detector.py ðŸ˜ˆU+1F50DðŸ¥‚

Purpose: 
For my first Cybersecurity related Python Script, I wanted to create a toolkit utilizing one of my favorite IP detection tools AbuseIP Database. The purpose of this script is to receive the user's input of a valid IP address and search the outcome via AbuseIPDB. This script will search an IP's repitation/malicious score and provide it's attributes.

Once the user receives the output, they can then determine if this IP depicts any danger or if additional reseach is needed to assist with their decision.
